Currently ID3v2, but more to follow.\r\n* Search. Supports word and quoted phrase matches using OR. e.g. \"The Doors\" \"Grant Green\"\r\n* Interface is fully JavaScript/Ajax powered.\r\n* Playlists\r\n* Infinite random playlist in radio mode. List may be filtered. In radio mode a random playlist will be generated and as each song finishes it's popped off the list and a new song is pushed onto the end.\r\n* Album art is pulled from ID3v2 first and falls back to a `cover.jpg` image in each folder.\r\n* Folder montages of cover art for top level folders.\r\n* No database, but could easily be supported in the future.\r\n* Mobile support. Chrome for iOS is supported when screen locked.\r\n* Keyboard shortcuts: Up/Down for Volume, Left/Right for Track Advancement, Space for Play/Pause, Backspace for Mute.\r\n* Auto-timeout of player after X amount of time. Presents an \"Are you still listening?\" message with confirm dialog.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nSee [Apache 2 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md).\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\n* PHP 5.3+\r\n* Webserver with PHP support. Apache2 recommended.\r\n* Flash or HTML5 capable web browser.\r\n* UNIX tools. These are required to build search and radio indexes as well as cover art.
